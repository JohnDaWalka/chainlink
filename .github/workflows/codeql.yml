  # This chooses which runner labels we pass for the matrix jobs above.
  # General Criteria:
  # 1. If we are going to 'skip' a test suite, we use the base Github-hosted runner.
  #   - This is based off `should-run-core-tests`, and `should-run-deployment-tests`
  # 2. If we are not skipping, we check if the PR has the "runs-on-opt-out" label.
  #   - If the PR has the label, we use the larger Github-hosted runners.
  #   - If the PR does not have the label, we use the self-hosted runners.
