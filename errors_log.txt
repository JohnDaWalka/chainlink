CHAINLINK-COMMON v0.8.1-0.20250718142925-3a134a44f96d UPDATE ERRORS LOG
================================================================

Final state after all cherry-picks and fixes applied:

RESOLVED ERRORS:
===============
✅ GetDONTime method signature - Fixed by updating to GetDONTime(context.Context) (time.Time, error)
✅ capabilities/fakes consensus interface - Fixed by updating Simple/Report methods and adding ChainSelector
✅ billing.NewWorkflowClient arguments - Fixed by adding logger parameter in both locations
✅ CapabilitiesRegistry NodeByPeerID method - Fixed by cherry-picking commit 9af582e557
✅ EVM relayer NewCCIPProvider/TON methods - Fixed by cherry-picking commits b2d7a9a707, b74dd22286
✅ Dummy relayer NewCCIPProvider/TON methods - Fixed by cherry-picking commits
✅ HeaderByNumber type conversion - Fixed

REMAINING EXTERNAL DEPENDENCY ERROR:
===================================
❌ chainlink-solana/pkg/solana: missing NewCCIPProvider method
   Location: ../../.asdf/installs/golang/1.24.2/packages/pkg/mod/github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-solana@v1.1.2-0.20250702130714-144d99d2d871/pkg/solana/relay.go:45:28
   Error: cannot use &Relayer{} as "github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-common/pkg/types".Relayer value
   Reason: *Relayer does not implement "github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-common/pkg/types".Relayer (missing method NewCCIPProvider)
   
   This is an EXTERNAL DEPENDENCY issue that cannot be resolved through cherry-picking
   the chainlink repository. The chainlink-solana package needs to be updated separately
   to implement the NewCCIPProvider method required by the new chainlink-common interface.

SUCCESSFUL COMMAND RESULTS:
==========================
✅ make gomodtidy - PASSED
✅ make generate - PASSED (except for external chainlink-solana dependency)
✅ Core functionality compilation - PASSED for all internal packages

VERIFICATION TESTS PASSED:
=========================
✅ ./core/services/workflows/v2
✅ ./core/capabilities/fakes  
✅ ./core/services/relay/dummy
✅ ./core/services/workflows/cmd/cre/utils

COMMITS APPLIED:
===============
- b2d7a9a707: Added NewCCIPProvider and TON methods to EVM relayer
- b74dd22286: Added NewCCIPProvider and TON methods to dummy relayer  
- 4585dc27be: Fixed billing client to pass logger parameter
- 9af582e557: Added NodeByPeerID method to capabilities registry
- Manual fixes: GetDONTime signature, capabilities/fakes interface updates, billing client in application.go

TARGET VERSION ACHIEVED:
========================
✅ github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-common v0.8.1-0.20250718142925-3a134a44f96d

CONCLUSION:
==========
All possible fixes have been applied using cherry-picks from develop branch.
The only remaining issue is the external chainlink-solana dependency which
is outside the scope of this repository and cannot be fixed through cherry-picking.
