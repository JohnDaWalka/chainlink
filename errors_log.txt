ERRORS FROM CHAINLINK-COMMON VERSION UPDATE:

1. core/services/relay/evm/evm.go:88:29: cannot use &Relayer{} (value of type *Relayer) as "github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-common/pkg/types".Relayer value in variable declaration: *Relayer does not implement "github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-common/pkg/types".Relayer (missing method NewCCIPProvider)

2. core/services/relay/evm/evm.go:1007:9: cannot use r (variable of type *Relayer) as "github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-common/pkg/types".EVMService value in return statement: *Relayer does not implement "github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-common/pkg/types".EVMService (wrong type for method BalanceAt)
   - have BalanceAt("context".Context, "github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-common/pkg/types/chains/evm".Address, *"math/big".Int) (*"math/big".Int, error)
   - want BalanceAt("context".Context, "github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-common/pkg/types/chains/evm".BalanceAtRequest) (*"github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-common/pkg/types/chains/evm".BalanceAtReply, error)

3. core/services/relay/evm/evm_service.go:81:73: undefined: evmtypes.Head
4. core/services/relay/evm/evm_service.go:84:19: undefined: evmtypes.Head
5. core/services/relay/evm/evm_service.go:254:87: undefined: evmtypes.Head
6. core/services/relay/evm/evm_service.go:255:18: undefined: evmtypes.Head

7. core/services/relay/evm/loop_impl.go:29:35: cannot use r (variable of type *Relayer) as "github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-common/pkg/types".Relayer value in argument to relay.NewServerAdapter: *Relayer does not implement "github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-common/pkg/types".Relayer (missing method NewCCIPProvider)

Summary of issues:
- Missing NewCCIPProvider method in Relayer
- BalanceAt method signature changed in EVMService interface
- evmtypes.Head is undefined (likely moved/renamed in chainlink-common)
