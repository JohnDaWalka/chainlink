## Chainlink End-to-end Tests
This directory hold `Chainlink` end-to-end tests using `Chainlink Testing Framework v2`

"End-to-end" refers to deploying all products using production images while managing the environment's composition. We test the assembled system as a **black box**, using TOML configuration inputs, URLs of deployed services, or contract addresses.
